# FPGA_Lab

Intended for free sharing of ideas and maintaining some aspect of version control.

Branches will be in the style of lab[lab_#]/[name of lab section]
ex. lab3/multiplexor_design

Add every lab prompt to the docs folder. 

Please comment on your code and name your variables something useful.
Come up with test cases as well. Once the lab works and passes all test cases, submit a merge request!
